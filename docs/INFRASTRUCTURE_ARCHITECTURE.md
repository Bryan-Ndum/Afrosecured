# AfroSecured Infrastructure Architecture

## Overview
AfroSecured is built as **infrastructure** - a platform that other companies build on top of, not a standalone product. Think Stripe for payments, Cloudflare for security, Twilio for communications.

## Core Principle: Security at Every Layer

### 1. Core Security Engine (Proprietary)
**What it does:** The "brain" that detects fraud
**Technology:**
- Behavioral biometrics algorithms (custom ML models)
- Real-time threat intelligence database
- Risk scoring engine with adaptive thresholds
- Pattern recognition for African-specific scams

**Why it's proprietary:**
- Custom ML models trained on African mobile money fraud patterns
- Community-sourced threat intelligence (network effects)
- Contextual understanding of local scam tactics

**Security measures:**
- Encrypted at rest and in transit
- Zero-knowledge architecture (we don't see transaction details)
- Differential privacy for ML training
- Regular security audits

### 2. API Platform Layer
**What it does:** Exposes security engine to partners
**Endpoints:**
\`\`\`
POST /v1/analyze-transaction
POST /v1/verify-recipient  
POST /v1/check-merchant
GET  /v1/threat-intelligence
WS   /v1/realtime-alerts
\`\`\`

**Security measures:**
- API key authentication with scopes
- Rate limiting (1000 req/min per partner)
- DDoS protection
- Request signing for sensitive operations
- IP whitelisting option
- Audit logging of all requests

**Performance:**
- Sub-100ms response time (p95)
- 99.99% uptime SLA
- Auto-scaling based on load
- Edge deployment in Lagos, Nairobi, Johannesburg

### 3. SDK & Libraries Layer
**What it does:** Makes integration easy for developers

**Mobile SDKs:**
\`\`\`javascript
// iOS (Swift)
import AfroSecured

AfroSecured.configure(apiKey: "as_live_...")
let risk = try await AfroSecured.analyzeTransaction(
    amount: 50000,
    recipient: "+254712345678"
)

// Android (Kotlin)
AfroSecured.init(apiKey = "as_live_...")
val risk = AfroSecured.analyzeTransaction(
    amount = 50000,
    recipient = "+254712345678"
)
\`\`\`

**Web Libraries:**
\`\`\`javascript
// React
import { useAfroSecured } from '@afrosecured/react'

const { analyzeTransaction } = useAfroSecured()
const risk = await analyzeTransaction({ amount, recipient })
\`\`\`

**Server Libraries:**
\`\`\`python
# Python
from afrosecured import AfroSecured

client = AfroSecured(api_key="as_live_...")
risk = client.analyze_transaction(
    amount=50000,
    recipient="+254712345678"
)
\`\`\`

**Security measures:**
- SDK code obfuscation
- Certificate pinning
- Local data encryption
- Secure key storage (Keychain/KeyStore)

### 4. Partner Dashboard Layer
**What it does:** Analytics and control center for partners

**Features:**
- Real-time fraud prevention metrics
- Transaction monitoring
- Custom rule configuration
- Webhook management
- API key management
- Audit logs
- Compliance reports

**Security measures:**
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management
- Activity logging
- Data export controls

## Security-First Design Principles

### 1. Zero-Trust Architecture
- Every request is authenticated
- No implicit trust between services
- Principle of least privilege
- Continuous verification

### 2. Data Isolation (Multi-Tenancy)
- Each partner has isolated database
- Encryption keys per tenant
- No data sharing between partners
- Separate compute resources

### 3. Encryption Everywhere
- TLS 1.3 for all connections
- AES-256 for data at rest
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Key rotation every 90 days

### 4. Compliance Built-In
- GDPR compliance (data portability, right to deletion)
- PCI-DSS for payment data
- Local regulations (Kenya Data Protection Act, etc.)
- SOC 2 Type II certification

### 5. Observability
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Real-time metrics (Prometheus)
- Log aggregation (ELK stack)
- Anomaly detection
- Automated alerting

### 6. Incident Response
- 24/7 security monitoring
- Automated threat detection
- Incident response playbooks
- Regular security drills
- Bug bounty program

## Technical Stack

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud:** Multi-cloud (AWS + GCP for redundancy)
- **Edge:** Cloudflare Workers for low latency
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase) with read replicas
- **Cache:** Redis for hot data
- **Queue:** RabbitMQ for async processing
- **Search:** Elasticsearch for threat intelligence

### Security
- **WAF:** Cloudflare WAF
- **DDoS:** Cloudflare DDoS protection
- **Secrets:** HashiCorp Vault
- **Monitoring:** Datadog + Sentry
- **Compliance:** Vanta for SOC 2

### Development
- **API:** Node.js + TypeScript
- **ML:** Python + TensorFlow
- **Mobile:** React Native
- **Web:** Next.js + React
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Testing:** Jest + Playwright

## Scaling Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP (0-10K transactions/day)
- Single region deployment
- Monolithic API
- Manual scaling

### Phase 2: Growth (10K-1M transactions/day)
- Multi-region deployment
- Microservices architecture
- Auto-scaling

### Phase 3: Scale (1M+ transactions/day)
- Global edge deployment
- Distributed ML inference
- Real-time data pipeline
- Custom hardware acceleration

## Business Model

### Pricing Tiers

**Starter (Fintechs)**
- $0.02 per transaction
- Up to 100K transactions/month
- Basic support

**Growth (Telcos)**
- $0.01 per transaction
- Up to 10M transactions/month
- Priority support
- Custom rules

**Enterprise (Banks)**
- Custom pricing
- Unlimited transactions
- Dedicated support
- White-label option
- On-premise deployment

### Revenue Projections

**Year 1:** 5 partners × 1M transactions/month × $0.01 = $50K MRR
**Year 2:** 20 partners × 10M transactions/month × $0.01 = $2M MRR
**Year 3:** 50 partners × 100M transactions/month × $0.005 = $25M MRR

## Competitive Moat

1. **Network Effects:** More users = better fraud detection
2. **Data Moat:** Proprietary African fraud patterns database
3. **Integration Lock-In:** Once embedded, hard to replace
4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Expensive to replicate
5. **Brand Trust:** "Powered by AfroSecured" badge

## Next Steps

1. **Build MVP:** Consumer mobile money protection app
2. **Collect Data:** 100K+ transactions to train ML models
3. **Prove ROI:** Show measurable fraud prevention
4. **Launch API:** Beta with 3-5 fintech partners
5. **Scale:** Expand to telcos and banks
6. **Exit:** Acquisition by Visa/Mastercard or IPO

---

**The goal:** Become the Stripe of fraud prevention for Africa's digital economy.
